## Movement Patterns

### Rush Phase Movement

```
Zone 1: Spawn → Obelisk (Left) → Iset-1
Zone 2: Spawn → Position near center
Zone 3: Spawn → Obelisk (Upper) → Iset-2/3
```

### Teleport Positioning

**First Wave Targets:**
1. Near obelisks (reinforce rush)
2. Near assigned Outposts
3. Central for Ark preparation

**Second Wave Targets:**
1. Fill garrison gaps
2. Reinforce weak buildings
3. Backup for attacks

### Defense Rotation

When buildings are attacked:

```
Priority Order:
1. Obelisks (highest value)
2. Ark (point generation)
3. Outposts (territorial control)
4. Altars (secondary points)
5. Shrines (temporary buffs)
```

## Tactical Considerations

### Choke Points

| Location | Why Important |
|----------|---------------|
| Center corridor | Access to Ark |
| Obelisk approaches | Rush path |
| Outpost clusters | Defense grouping |

### Line of Sight

- Rallies visible from spawn
- Can see enemy teleports
- Watch for flanking

### Distance Factors

| From | To | March Time |
|------|-----|------------|
| Spawn | Nearest Obelisk | ~30 seconds |
| Spawn | Ark | ~45 seconds |
| Obelisk | Adjacent altar | ~20 seconds |
| Your Outpost | Enemy Outpost | ~40 seconds |

## Map Awareness Tips

1. **Watch the minimap** - See enemy movements early
2. **Track rally markers** - Know where enemies are attacking
3. **Note teleport flashes** - Enemy reinforcements incoming
4. **Count enemy troops** - Estimate garrison strength
5. **Time shrine spawns** - Be ready to contest
