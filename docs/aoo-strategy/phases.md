# Battle Phases

Ark of Osiris battles follow four distinct phases. Understanding each phase is critical for coordinated team play.

## Phase 1: RUSH (0:00 - 5:00)

**Objective:** Capture obelisks before the enemy

### Key Actions

| Zone | Target | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| Zone 1 | Obelisk (Left) | Fastest cavalry |
| Zone 3 | Obelisk (Upper) | Fastest cavalry |
| Zone 2 | Prepare for teleport | Rally leaders ready |

### Tips

- **Speed is everything** - Only your fastest marches should rush
- Use cavalry commanders with march speed talents
- Don't stop to fight - capture first, reinforce later
- If enemy reaches first, call for backup immediately

> **Critical:** Obelisk control in the first 5 minutes often determines the match outcome.

## Phase 2: SECURE OUR HALF (~5:00 - 15:00)

**Objective:** Establish control of your team's territory

### Two-Troop System

Every player should have two marches ready:

| March | Troop Type | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **March 1** | Cavalry | Conquer buildings quickly |
| **March 2** | Infantry | Garrison and defend |

### Teleport Waves

**First Wave:**
- Rally leaders teleport immediately
- Begin rallying assigned structures
- Priority: Outposts of Iset

**Second Wave:**
- Support players teleport after rallies start
- Reinforce garrisons
- Fill any empty buildings

### Tips

- Don't teleport until leaders call
- Infantry garrisons are stronger than cavalry
- Keep reinforcements ready for attacked buildings
- Communicate enemy movements in chat

## Phase 3: ARK + FORTIFY (~15:00 - 45:00)

**Objective:** Capture the Ark and solidify defense

### Ark Strategy

The Ark is the central objective worth massive points:

1. **Preparation** (minute 14)
   - Position rally leaders near center
   - Have 3rd march ready for Ark capture

2. **Capture** (minute 15)
   - Zone 2 leaders rally the Ark
   - Once captured, STAY IN THE BUILDING
   - Don't leave to fight - you'll lose the Ark

3. **Defense**
   - All players reinforce Ark garrison
   - Maximum troops = maximum points per tick

### Garrison Checklist

Before moving to offense, verify:

- [ ] All Obelisks garrisoned
- [ ] All Outposts of Iset garrisoned
- [ ] Altars on your half captured
- [ ] Shrines contested when available
- [ ] Ark fully reinforced

### Farming for Points

While waiting for objectives:
- Farm resource nodes for alliance points
- Stay near your assigned zone
- Keep one march ready for emergency defense

## Phase 4: HOLD & SELECTIVE PUSH (~45:00 - End)

**Objective:** Maintain control and opportunistic offense

### Defense First Priority

> **Golden Rule:** Never push enemy territory if your half isn't secure.

Check before any offensive action:
1. Are all your buildings fully garrisoned?
2. Is the Ark secure?
3. Do you have backup if the push fails?

### When to Push

Only push enemy territory when:
- Leaders call for it
- Your half is completely secure
- You have troop advantage
- Enemy garrisons are weak

### Rally Coordination

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Leader calls push | Join rally immediately |
| Enemy pushing you | Defend first, skip rally |
| Tied score | Focus on defense |
| Big lead | Conservative - don't throw |

### Final Minutes

In the last 5-10 minutes:
- Stop all risky pushes
- Maximum defense mode
- Every troop in garrisons
- Watch for enemy desperation attacks

## Common Mistakes
