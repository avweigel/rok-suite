# Alliance Protocols

Coordination procedures for alliance activities.

## Guardian Runs

### Schedule

Guardians spawn at fixed UTC times. Check the in-app guardian timer for exact spawn times in your timezone.

### Protocol

**Before Spawn (5 min)**
1. Rally leader announces incoming guardian in alliance chat
2. Members prepare marches and position near guardian location
3. Avoid starting other activities that lock troops

**During Spawn**
1. Rally leader starts rally immediately
2. Members join rally (max capacity)
3. Additional members garrison nearby structures
4. Coordinate reinforcements if rally fills

**After Kill**
1. Rally leader collects rewards
2. Report kill in alliance chat
3. Prepare for next guardian if multiple spawning

### Guardian Management

- **Priority**: Higher-tier guardians provide better buffs
- **Timing**: Spawns are predictable - plan ahead
- **Coordination**: One rally leader per guardian to avoid confusion

## Rally Protocol

### Starting a Rally

1. Announce target in alliance chat
2. Wait for acknowledgment from key members
