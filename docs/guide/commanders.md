# Commander Strategy

Progression paths and pairing recommendations for Rise of Kingdoms commanders.

## Progression Paths

### F2P Path

**Early Game (CH 1-16)**
1. Focus on gathering commanders (Constance, Sarka, Gaius)
2. Max Lohar for barbarian hunting
3. Invest in Sun Tzu as first epic infantry
4. Save gems for Wheel of Fortune

**Mid Game (CH 17-22)**
1. Max YSG (Yi Seong-Gye) from Wheel of Fortune
2. Build Richard I from daily chests
3. Invest in Alex (Alexander the Great) when available
4. Keep 1-2 commanders per troop type

**Late Game (CH 23-25)**
1. Focus on meta legendary commanders
2. Pair based on your troop specialization
3. Optimize talent trees for specific roles
4. Consider equipment sets

### P2P Path

**Recommended Investment Order**
1. YSG (versatile, strong AOE)
2. Alex (infantry, PvP staple)
3. Guan Yu (infantry, rally leader)
4. Cavalry or Archer legendaries based on preference
