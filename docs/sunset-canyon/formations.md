# Formation Strategy for Sunset Canyon

This guide covers positioning tactics and formation strategies for Sunset Canyon defense.

## Battle Mechanics

### How Targeting Works

```
Your Formation:            Enemy Formation:
Back:  [B0] [B1] [B2] [B3]    [B3] [B2] [B1] [B0]
Front: [F0] [F1] [F2] [F3]    [F3] [F2] [F1] [F0]
```

**Targeting Priority:**
1. Front-row targets directly in front
2. Back-row targets directly behind front target
3. If no direct target: closest front-row target
4. If no front-row left: nearest back-row target

**Key insight:** Armies attack their mirror position first, then spread outward.

### What Affects Combat

In Sunset Canyon, **only these factors matter:**

| Affects Combat | Does NOT Affect |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Commander level | Equipment bonuses |
| Commander skills | Kingdom buffs |
| Commander talents | Alliance tech |
| Troop type selection | Research bonuses |
| Formation positioning | VIP buffs |

This makes **commander investment** the most important factor.

## Optimal Formation Structure

### The 2-3 Tank Rule

> "If you use 1 tank and 4 backline armies, all enemies focus the tank and it dies fast." — [RiseOfKingdomsGuides](https://riseofkingdomsguides.com/guides/sunset-canyon/)

**Recommended:** 2-3 tanks in front row

| Formation | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|------|------|
| 2 Front / 3 Back | More damage output | Less survivable |
| 3 Front / 2 Back | Maximum tankiness | Less AOE coverage |

**General rule:** Use 2 tanks if your tanks are strong. Use 3 if they're weaker or you lack good back-row options.

### Position Priorities

```
Back Row:
┌────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┐
│ Edge   │ CENTER │ CENTER │ Edge   │
│ Slot 0 │ Slot 1 │ Slot 2 │ Slot 3 │
│        │  AOE   │  AOE   │        │
│Support │ 5-tgt  │ 5-tgt  │ Damage │
└────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┘

Front Row:
┌────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┐
│ Edge   │ CENTER │ CENTER │ Edge   │
│ Slot 0 │ Slot 1 │ Slot 2 │ Slot 3 │
│        │  Tank  │  Tank  │        │
│ Tank   │ (Best) │ (2nd)  │ Empty  │
└────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┘
```

### Why Center Matters

**Front Center (Slots 1-2):**
- Absorbs attacks from multiple enemy positions
- Best tanks should go here

**Back Center (Slots 1-2):**
- AOE skills hit more targets from center
- YSG's fan-shaped arrow maximizes coverage here

> "Place YSG in center position to make sure he really hits as many armies as possible with his primary skill." — [AllClash](https://www.allclash.com/yi-seong-gye/)

## Recommended Formations

### Standard Defense (Balanced)

```
Back:  [Support] [5-AOE]  [5-AOE]  [Damage]
Front: [Tank]    [Tank]   [Tank]   [---]
```

**Example:**
```
Back:  Joan/Boudica | YSG/Aethel | Sun Tzu/Martel | Mehmed/Any
Front: Richard/Any | Constantine/Wu | Guan Yu/Leo  | ---
```

### Tank-Heavy (Survivability)

```
Back:  [Support] [AOE]    [---]    [---]
Front: [Tank]    [Tank]   [Tank]   [Tank]
```

Use when: You have many good tanks but fewer damage dealers.

### Damage-Focused (Glass Cannon)

```
Back:  [AOE]     [AOE]    [AOE]    [Damage]
Front: [Tank]    [Tank]   [---]    [---]
```

Use when: You have excellent back-row commanders and want fast elimination.

## Troop Type Selection

### Best: Infantry Core

> "Infantry units are a top choice for Sunset Canyon due to their resilience and ability to hold their ground." — [RiseOfKingdomsGuides](https://riseofkingdomsguides.com/guides/sunset-canyon/)

Infantry dominates Canyon because:
- Counters cavalry (common attacker choice)
- High survivability for front line
- Works well with most meta commanders

### Avoid: Cavalry Heavy

> "Cavalry is not great in Sunset Canyon because you will face Charles Martel, Richard, Sun Tzu, etc. a lot." — [ROK.guide](https://www.rok.guide/best-sunset-canyon-commanders/)

Cavalry struggles because:
- Countered by infantry (60%+ of defenses)
- Charles Martel shield absorbs cavalry burst
- Richard's healing outlasts cavalry damage

### Exception: Baibars

Baibars is the **one cavalry commander** viable in Canyon:
- 5-target AOE compensates for cavalry weakness
- Pairs well with Aethelflaed (slowed targets take extra damage)

## Timing Strategy

### Daily Optimization

> "Do Sunset Canyons at 23:55 UTC every day. If it's Sunday, do it at 23:50 UTC." — [ROK.guide](https://www.rok.guide/sunset-canyon-tips/)

**Why late timing?**
- Fewer players online to attack you
- Less time for attackers to counter your defense
- Locks in your rank before reset

### Defense Maintenance

> "Keep a check on your defense now and then. You have to manually put the updated dispatches whenever your commanders level up." — [ROK.guide](https://www.rok.guide/sunset-canyon-tips/)

**Update your defense when:**
- Commanders level up (significant power increase)
- You acquire new commanders
- Skills are upgraded
- Meta shifts (new commanders released)

## Counter-Attack Awareness

### Attacker Advantage

> "You are much weaker when defending than attacking because people can counter your defense." — [AllClash](https://www.allclash.com/sunset-canyon-defense-guide/)

Attackers can:
1. See your full formation
2. Choose commanders to counter yours
3. Adjust troop types to exploit weaknesses

**This is why defenses cap at ~80% win rate.** A perfect defense still loses to a smart attacker.

### Making Your Defense Harder to Counter

**Good practices:**
- Mix infantry and archer (harder to counter than mono-type)
- Include silence/disable (Hermann, Guan Yu) to disrupt attacker skills
- Use Richard to outlast burst strategies
- Put tanky AOE (Aethelflaed) to survive while dealing damage

**Avoid:**
- Pure cavalry (easily countered)
- All nukers, no tanks (dies before dealing damage)
- Single tank (focused down immediately)

## Advanced Tactics

### Position Swapping

If you notice you're losing to specific counter-strategies:

1. **Against Cavalry Rushers:** More infantry in front
2. **Against AOE Heavy:** Spread your formation (edge slots)
3. **Against Single-Target Nukers:** Concentrate in center (split damage)

### Reading Enemy Patterns

Check common attack formations in your ranking bracket:
- If everyone uses Richard/Constantine: Bring anti-heal (Ramesses)
- If everyone uses YSG: Bring silence (Hermann, Guan Yu)
- If everyone uses cavalry: Double down on infantry

## Summary Checklist

Before finalizing your defense:

- [ ] 2-3 tanks in front row
- [ ] AOE commanders in back center (slots 1-2)
- [ ] No solo cavalry (except Baibars with AOE pair)
- [ ] At least one silence/disable commander
- [ ] Mix of infantry and archer (not mono-cavalry)
- [ ] Update when commanders level up
