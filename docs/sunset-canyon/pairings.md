# Commander Pairings for Sunset Canyon

This guide covers the best commander pairings for Sunset Canyon defense, based on community research and meta analysis.

## How Pairings Work

In Rise of Kingdoms, two commanders lead each army:

| Role | Talents | Skills | Position |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| **Primary** | Active | Active | Determines march type |
| **Secondary** | Inactive | Active | Supports primary |

**Key insight:** Secondary commanders cannot use their talents, only their skills. This means:
- Same troop type = better talent synergy
- Skill interactions are more important than individual talent builds

## S-Tier Pairings (Must-Use)

### Infantry Pairings

| Primary | Secondary | Why It Works |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Guan Yu** | **Leonidas** | Guan's silence enables Leonidas's 50% skill damage boost. "One of the strongest marches in RoK" |
| **Sun Tzu** | **Charles Martel** | Sun Tzu adds damage + rage to Martel's tankiness. 30% skill damage boost |
| **Sun Tzu** | **Richard I** | Best AOE duo - hit 5 targets while Richard's heals maintain troop count |
| **Charles Martel** | **Richard I** | "Best infantry march for open-field and garrison defense" - pure tank |
| **Constantine I** | **Wu Zetian** | "Best all-around defensive pairing" - counters nukers, massive damage reduction |

### Archer/Mixed Pairings

| Primary | Secondary | Why It Works |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Aethelflaed** | **Yi Seong-Gye** | Top F2P combo - 30% stat debuff + 5-target AOE devastation |
| **Yi Seong-Gye** | **Sun Tzu** | "Craziest AOE combination" - both hit 5 targets |
| **Artemisia I** | **Yi Seong-Gye** | Archer AOE synergy - 50% more skill damage together |
| **Artemisia I** | **Ramesses II** | Tanky archer pair with defense tree + debuff damage |

### Cavalry (Use Cautiously)

> "Cavalry is not great in Sunset Canyon because you will face Charles Martel, Richard, Sun Tzu, etc. a lot and those guys can beat cavalry with ease."

| Primary | Secondary | Why It Works |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Baibars** | **Saladin** | Exception to cavalry weakness - Baibars has 5-target AOE |
| **Baibars** | **Aethelflaed** | AOE + debuff combo, slowed targets take extra damage |

## A-Tier Pairings (Strong Options)

| Primary | Secondary | Why It Works |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Alexander the Great** | **Guan Yu** | Shield + massive damage combo |
| **Joan of Arc** | **Charles Martel** | Buffer + tank, great survivability |
| **Joan of Arc** | **Hermann** | Solid silencer combo to counter nukers |
| **Scipio Africanus** | **Charles Martel** | Good Canyon tank, Scipio adds troop capacity |
| **Mehmed II** | **Yi Seong-Gye** | Conquering AOE, works like YSG but less damage |
| **Harald Sigurdsson** | **Sun Tzu** | Infantry damage + buff, stronger vs multiple enemies |

## B-Tier Pairings (Viable Early-Mid Game)

| Primary | Secondary | Why It Works |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Eulji Mundeok** | **Sun Tzu** | Infantry debuffer, weakens enemy front line |
| **Bjorn Ironside** | **Sun Tzu** | Epic infantry with skill damage boost |
| **Kusunoki Masashige** | **Yi Seong-Gye** | Archer AOE with garrison defense |
| **Boudica** | **Joan of Arc** | Rage engine with healing, sustain support |

## Pairing Mechanics Explained

### Synergy Types

**1. Skill Damage Amplification**
```
Guan Yu silences target → Leonidas deals +50% skill damage to silenced
```

**2. Debuff + Damage Combo**
```
Aethelflaed reduces stats 30% → All damage is more effective
Baibars slows targets → Aethelflaed deals bonus to slowed targets
```

**3. Rage Generation**
```
Sun Tzu restores 250 rage → Partners spam skills faster
```

**4. Sustain Combos**
```
Richard heals → High troop count → More damage output
Constantine reduces damage → Survives longer → More skill cycles
```

### Troop Type Matching

| Troop Type | Strength | Weakness |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **Infantry** | Tanky, counters cavalry | Slower damage |
| **Archer** | AOE damage, skill-focused | Fragile |
| **Cavalry** | Fast, high burst | Countered by infantry (common in Canyon) |
| **Mixed** | Flexible | No specialized bonuses |

**Best for Canyon:** Infantry + Archer mix (tanks front, AOE back)

**Recommended F2P Formation:**
```
Back:  Aethelflaed/YSG  |  Sun Tzu/Joan  |  [Any AOE]  |  [Support]
Front: Charles Martel   |  Richard I     |  [Tank]
```
