# Commander Pairings for Sunset Canyon

This guide covers the best commander pairings for Sunset Canyon defense, based on community research and meta analysis.

## How Pairings Work

In Rise of Kingdoms, two commanders lead each army:

| Role | Talents | Skills | Position |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| **Primary** | Active | Active | Determines march type |
| **Secondary** | Inactive | Active | Supports primary |

**Key insight:** Secondary commanders cannot use their talents, only their skills. This means:
- The **primary commander's talent tree** is what makes or breaks the march
- Skill interactions are more important than individual talent builds for secondaries
- Some commanders MUST be primary due to their talent tree value

### Primary/Secondary Position Guide (Dec 2025)

Based on research from ROK community guides, certain commanders should always be primary or secondary:

| Commander | Position | Reason |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Guan Yu** | **Primary** | "You must use Sun Tzu as secondary because of Guan Yu's talent tree" |
| **Charles Martel** | **Primary** | "Most people are better off using him as primary in an individual tank slot" |
| **Richard I** | **Primary** | Garrison/defense talent tree is valuable for Canyon defense |
| **Sun Tzu** | **Primary** | Skill tree is very valuable for damage builds |
| **Aethelflaed** | **Primary** | "Aethelflaed primary + YSG secondary" for excellent AOE |
| **Constantine I** | **Primary** | Garrison talent tree is valuable |
| **Wu Zetian** | **Primary** | Leadership talent tree is valuable |
| **Yi Seong-Gye** | **Secondary** | Skills are the value (5-target AOE), not talent tree |
| **Eulji Mundeok** | **Secondary** | Defense reduction debuff is the value |
| **Joan of Arc** | **Either** | Works well as primary or secondary |
| **Björn Ironside** | **Either** | Works as primary or secondary |

## S-Tier Pairings (Must-Use)

### Infantry Pairings

| Primary | Secondary | Why It Works |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Guan Yu** | **Leonidas** | Guan's silence enables Leonidas's 50% skill damage boost. "One of the strongest marches in RoK" [^1] |
| **Sun Tzu** | **Charles Martel** | Sun Tzu adds damage + rage to Martel's tankiness. 30% skill damage boost |
| **Sun Tzu** | **Richard I** | Best AOE duo - hit 5 targets while Richard's heals maintain troop count |
| **Charles Martel** | **Richard I** | "Best infantry march for open-field and garrison defense" [^2] - pure tank |
| **Constantine I** | **Wu Zetian** | "Best all-around defensive pairing" [^3] - counters nukers, massive damage reduction |

### Archer/Mixed Pairings

| Primary | Secondary | Why It Works |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Aethelflaed** | **Yi Seong-Gye** | Top F2P combo - 30% stat debuff + 5-target AOE devastation [^4] |
| **Yi Seong-Gye** | **Sun Tzu** | "Craziest AOE combination" [^5] - both hit 5 targets |
| **Artemisia I** | **Yi Seong-Gye** | Archer AOE synergy - 50% more skill damage together |
| **Artemisia I** | **Ramesses II** | Tanky archer pair with defense tree + debuff damage |

### Cavalry (Use Cautiously)

> "Cavalry is not great in Sunset Canyon because you will face Charles Martel, Richard, Sun Tzu, etc. a lot and those guys can beat cavalry with ease." — [ROK.guide](https://www.rok.guide/best-sunset-canyon-commanders/)

| Primary | Secondary | Why It Works |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Baibars** | **Saladin** | Exception to cavalry weakness - Baibars has 5-target AOE |
| **Baibars** | **Aethelflaed** | AOE + debuff combo, slowed targets take extra damage |

## A-Tier Pairings (Strong Options)

| Primary | Secondary | Why It Works |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Alexander the Great** | **Guan Yu** | Shield + massive damage combo |
| **Joan of Arc** | **Charles Martel** | Buffer + tank, great survivability |
| **Joan of Arc** | **Hermann** | Solid silencer combo to counter nukers |
| **Scipio Africanus** | **Charles Martel** | Good Canyon tank, Scipio adds troop capacity |
| **Mehmed II** | **Yi Seong-Gye** | Conquering AOE, works like YSG but less damage |
| **Harald Sigurdsson** | **Sun Tzu** | Infantry damage + buff, stronger vs multiple enemies |

## B-Tier Pairings (Viable Early-Mid Game)

| Primary | Secondary | Why It Works |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Sun Tzu** | **Eulji Mundeok** | Infantry debuffer, weakens enemy front line (Eulji should be secondary!) |
| **Sun Tzu** | **Bjorn Ironside** | Epic infantry with skill damage boost |
| **Kusunoki Masashige** | **Yi Seong-Gye** | Archer AOE with garrison defense |
| **Boudica** | **Joan of Arc** | Rage engine with healing, sustain support |

## Pairing Mechanics Explained

### Synergy Types

**1. Skill Damage Amplification**
```
Guan Yu silences target → Leonidas deals +50% skill damage to silenced
```

**2. Debuff + Damage Combo**
```
Aethelflaed reduces stats 30% → All damage is more effective
Baibars slows targets → Aethelflaed deals bonus to slowed targets
```

**3. Rage Generation**
```
Sun Tzu restores 250 rage → Partners spam skills faster
```

**4. Sustain Combos**
```
Richard heals → High troop count → More damage output
Constantine reduces damage → Survives longer → More skill cycles
```

### Talent Tree Synergies (NEW)

The optimizer now considers talent tree compatibility. Each commander has primary talent trees that affect pairing effectiveness:

| Tree Type | Benefits | Example Commanders |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Infantry** | Troop-specific buffs (infantry) | Guan Yu, Charles Martel, Richard I |
| **Cavalry** | Troop-specific buffs (cavalry) | Attila, Takeda, Cao Cao |
| **Archer** | Troop-specific buffs (archer) | YSG, Hermann Prime, Ramesses II |
| **Leadership** | Buffs ALL troop types | Constantine I, Theodora, Joan |
| **Integration** | Mixed troop bonuses | Joan of Arc, Aethelflaed, Mulan |
| **Garrison** | Defense bonuses | Charles Martel, Richard I, YSG |
| **Skill** | Skill damage amplification | Sun Tzu, Guan Yu, YSG |

**Best Talent Tree Combinations:**

| Primary Tree | Secondary Tree | Bonus | Example |
|--------------|----------------|-------|---------|
| Infantry + Infantry | +25 | Focused specialization | Guan Yu + Richard I |
| Leadership + Any | +15 | Versatile buffing | Constantine + anyone |
| Garrison + Garrison | +20 | Strong Canyon defense | Charles Martel + Richard I |
| Skill + Skill | +15 | Synergized skill damage | YSG + Sun Tzu |

### Skill Effect Combinations (NEW)

The optimizer scores commanders based on complementary skill effects:

| Effect Combo | Bonus | Why It Works |
|--------------|-------|--------------|
| **Debuff + AOE Damage** | +20 | Reduced stats mean all AOE hits harder |
| **Defense Reduction + AOE** | +15 | Devastating combo for Canyon multi-target |
| **Silence + Damage** | +15 | Enemy can't skill while you damage |
| **Heal + Shield** | +15 | Maximum sustain for front line |
| **Double AOE** | +20 | Both commanders hit 5 targets |
| **Rage Boost + Any** | +10 | Faster skill cycling |

**Formation-Level Coverage:**

A "well-rounded" formation should have:
- ✅ **Debuff effects**: Attack/defense reduction (Aethelflaed, Ramesses)
- ✅ **Damage effects**: AOE, damage boost, DOT (YSG, Sun Tzu)
- ✅ **Sustain effects**: Healing, shields (Richard, Charles Martel)

Formations with all three categories get +30 bonus: "Full combat coverage"

### Troop Type Matching

| Troop Type | Strength | Weakness |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **Infantry** | Tanky, counters cavalry | Slower damage |
| **Archer** | AOE damage, skill-focused | Fragile |
| **Cavalry** | Fast, high burst | Countered by infantry (common in Canyon) |
| **Mixed** | Flexible | No specialized bonuses |

**Best for Canyon:** Infantry + Archer mix (tanks front, AOE back)
