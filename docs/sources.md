## Key Research Findings

The following insights from community research are implemented in our algorithms:

> — AllClash

### Troop Types
> "Cavalry is not great in Sunset Canyon because you will face Charles Martel, Richard, Sun Tzu, etc. a lot and those guys can beat cavalry with ease."
> — ROK.guide

> "Infantry units are a top choice for Sunset Canyon due to their resilience and ability to hold their ground."
> — Multiple sources

### Defense Limitations
> "You are much weaker when defending than attacking because people can counter your defense."
> — ROK.guide
